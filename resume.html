        As the Founder of Dented Code Academy, I’ve dedicated my career to
        bridging the gap between education and real-world industry demands. Too
        many aspiring developers struggle with moving from academic knowledge to
        actual job-ready skills. That’s why I built a system that
        works—mentorship-driven, industry-focused, and outcome-oriented.

        practical skills that they need to get hired in the IT industry. What
        you learn in your IT degree is not always sufficient to solve real-world
